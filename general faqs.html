    <h3 id="c1"> What is Income-tax?</h3>
    <p>​​It is a tax levied by the Government of India on the income of every person. The provisions governing the Income-tax are covered in the Income-tax Act, 1961.​ What is the administrative framework of Income-tax? ​ The revenue functions of the Government
        of India are managed by the Ministry of Finance. The Finance Ministry has entrusted the task of administration of direct taxes like Income-tax, Wealth tax, etc., to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). The CBDT is a part of Department of
        Revenue in the Ministry of Finance. CBDT provides essential inputs for policy framing and planning of direct taxes and also administers the direct tax laws through the Income-tax Department. Thus, Income-tax Law is administrated by the Income-tax

    <p>Income-tax is levied on the annual income of a person. The year under the Income-tax Law is the period starting from 1st April and ending on 31st March of next calendar year. The Income-tax Law classifies the year as (1) Previous year, and (2) Assessment
        year. The year in which income is earned is called as previous year and the year in which the income is charged to tax is called as assessment year. e.g., Income earned during the period of 1st April, 2019 to 31st March, 2020 is treated as income
        of the previous year 2019-20. Income of the previous year 2019-20 will be charged to tax in the next year, i.e., in the assessment year 2020-21.​
